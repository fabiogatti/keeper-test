# keeper-test

Hello and welcome!

For the test i tried to stick to the time limit, i think i did around 7 hours of work (switching between on and off)
I didn't really find necessary to use Vuex nor Vue router.
The only thing that i think its missing from the functional design is the create role button. Everything else i think is working just fine.
Hope you enjoy the design!
